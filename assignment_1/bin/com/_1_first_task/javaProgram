public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}


1. I am saving this file name as the Main.java
2. I open the command and give the path of the directory where I save my Main.java fife cd Desktop
3. The compiler compiles the Java source file using the javac command
   javac Main.java -> This command compiles the Java source code into bytecode and generates the .class file.

4. After that we can run our Java program successfully using the command
   -> java Main
   -> This will execute the Java program, and we should see "Hello, World!" printed in the command prompt.
   -> Successfully created and executed a "Hello World" program in Java using Notepad and CMD.
